# The Hangman Game

- The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen word, one letter at a time. The game provides visual feedback using stages of a "hanging man," and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct word.

---

### Features:

- Random Word Selection: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Visual Stages: A progressive hangman graphic (stages) updates with each incorrect guess.
- Feedback System: Correct guesses reveal their positions in the word, while incorrect guesses reduce lives.
- Win or Lose Conditions: The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or the player runs out of lives.
